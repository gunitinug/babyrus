Lookup by filepath -> edge case when there are no registered files. [fixed]
Manage ebooks:Add new ebook -> Enter search term -> Explain empty is wildcard. NOT a glob so * is literal \*. [fixed]
Manage ebooks:Add new ebook -> Search: Perhaps add in_operation box while waiting. [fixed]

Edit Note -> Remove tag doesn't work. Adding more than one tag doesn't work.
Seems to be a problem with regisering tag. Maybe not? Seems to work now. Find out what edge case is involved here. [skip for now]

Edit Note->Manage Tags: When Cancel selected shouldn't update tags. [just renamed 'Cancel' to 'Back']

Open and Read seems to be functional.

View all reg tags: maybe if empty display msgbox instead of blank box. same with show all reg ebooks. [fixed]

Truncating path blah/.../blah seems good compared to blah...blah.

Need a better UI for removing tag from a particular book.

Assoc tag with ebook -> if no match it just returns. Should display a msgbox saying No matches.

Edit Note -> When adding new ebook, perhaps filter by ebook tag too.

Feature suggest: maybe function to delete tag from global list (for manage notes).

If file name contains |,#:; from within manage ebooks (main menu) offer to deregister, rename, reregister file (maybe, also in bulk).

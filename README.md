## üöÄ What is Babyrus?

**Babyrus** is a terminal-based productivity application that helps you manage projects, take notes, and organize digital resources‚Äîespecially **eBooks** and **URLs**. It provides a structured workflow across three core layers:

* **Manage eBooks**
* **Manage Notes**
* **Manage Goals**

You start by setting up a project and defining your goals, then write notes, and finally link those notes to relevant resources like eBooks or websites. Each layer works seamlessly together to support your planning, learning, and execution process.

### üìñ Key Features

* Associate eBooks with notes and tags
* Register `chapter:page` pairs to jump to specific eBook sections (using external viewers like *Evince*)
* Link notes with URLs (e.g., YouTube, online articles)
* Organize and filter by **tags**
* Handle large libraries with bulk eBook management
* Designed to scale‚Äîfrom a few notes to thousands of files

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Update the following section in the script to define which external apps to use:

```bash
# External apps for eBook handling
declare -A EXTENSION_COMMANDS=(
    ["txt"]="gnome-text-editor"
    ["pdf"]="evince"
    ["epub"]="okular"
    ["mobi"]="xdg-open"
    ["azw3"]="xdg-open"
)

# Editors/viewers for other sections
DEFAULT_EDITOR="nano"         # Used inside the terminal
URL_BROWSER="google-chrome"   # Used to open URLs
DEFAULT_VIEWER="evince"       # Used to view eBooks
```

Ensure all specified programs are installed. The script will exit if any are missing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Changing Default Viewer

If you change `DEFAULT_VIEWER` from `evince` to another app, update this function accordingly:

```bash
open_evince() {
    local selected_ebook="$1"
    local page="$2"
    [[ -z "$selected_ebook" ]] && return 1

    local ebook_path=$(cut -d'#' -f1 <<< "$selected_ebook")
    [[ -f "$ebook_path" ]] || {
        whiptail --msgbox "Ebook not found: $ebook_path" 20 80
        return 1
    }

    if [ -z "$page" ]; then
        "$DEFAULT_VIEWER" "$ebook_path" &> /dev/null & disown
    else
        "$DEFAULT_VIEWER" -p "$page" "$ebook_path" &> /dev/null & disown
        # ‚ö†Ô∏è Adjust this line if your viewer does not support the -p option
    fi
}
```

Replace the `-p "$page"` argument as needed for compatibility with your chosen viewer.

## üìÅ Files Managed by Babyrus

Babyrus creates and manages the following files and directories. If deleted, blank versions will be regenerated when you run the script again. Backups are saved as `backup_*.tar.gz` in the `babyrus/` folder. You can back up or restore files via the main menu.

```bash
readonly BACKUP_ENTRIES=(
  "ebooks.db"
  "ebooks.db.backup"
  "ebooks.db.rename.log"
  "tags.db"
  "notes/*.txt"
  "notes/metadata/notes.db"
  "notes/metadata/notes-ebooks.db"
  "notes/metadata/notes-tags.db"
  "projects/*.txt"
  "projects/metadata/projects.db"
